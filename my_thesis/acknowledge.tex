Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor Yann LeCun for believing in
unsupervised learning both for machines and students. His unwaivering
enthusiasm and commitment to tackling the hard problems inspired many to make
steady progress in this emerging area of research.

I thank many colleagues that have passed through our lab over the years.
Particularly, Joan Bruna who tough me that patient, deliberate thought is the
surest way to find structure in chaos.  I thank Jonathan Tompson for being a
great friend and showing me what it means to be a truly great
multi-disciplinary engineer.  I owe a debt of gratitude to David Eigen, who
provided invaluable insight to many hard problems. My thanks to the
neuroscience folks ``across the street'', Eero Simoncelli and his lab members,
for providing many insightful discussions. Many thanks to Julian Panetta for
his patient help in everything from proof-reading papers to answering many
``embarrassing'' computer science related questions.  
      
I'm thankful to my old friends Mohammad and Ramzy for providing their
friendship, guidance, support, and encouragement over many years.  I thank my
friends and colleagues at NSWC-PCD for their many years of support and
encouragement. Finally, I'm grateful to my parents who have remained patient
and supportive through my many years in school.  Last, but certainly not least,
thank you Emer for your love and support.
