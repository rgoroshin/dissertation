Firstly, I would like to thank Yann LeCun for believing in unsupervised
learning both for machines and students. His unwaivering belief inspired many
to make slow, but steady progress in this difficult area of research.

I thank many colleagues that have passed through our lab over the years.
Particularly, Joan Bruna who tough me that patient, deliberate thought is the
surest way to find structure in chaos.  I thank Jonathan Tompson for showing me
what it means to be a truly great multi-disciplinary engineer.  I owe a debt of
gratitude to David Eigen, who provided invaluable insight to many hard
problems.  Many thanks to Julian Panetta for his patient help in everything
from proof-reading papers to answering many ``embarrassing'' computer science
related questions. 
      
I'm grateful to parents who have remained patient and supportive through my
many, many, years in school.
