Sparse inference refers to the problem of finding the coefficients $z$ which
reconstruct the input $x$ as a sparse linear combination of some basis elements
contained an over-complete dictionary $W_d$. In general, sparse inference is an 
intractable combinatorial problem. A relaxation of the sparse inference problem is
the so called lasso, 

\begin{equation}
L_{lasso} = \min_Z \frac{1}{2}\|X-W_dZ\| + \alpha |Z|_1 
\end{equation}
